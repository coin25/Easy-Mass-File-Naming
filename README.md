# Easy-Mass-File-Naming

NOTE THIS WILL IRREVERSIBLY CHANGE FILENAMES IN A GIVEN LOCATION. BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO RUIN A FOLDER.

A simple script to rename all files in a folder numerically.
Ex.) Island.jpg, Earth.jpg --> 1.jpg, 2.jpg 

How to use:
Simply change the "FOLDER/" to the desired folder, be sure all the file extensions are what you want.
By default the file extension is .jpg

Feel free to let me know how I can improve the code, I just wrote this up in a few minutes for another program.
